StaticBuilder Plugin for Kirby CMS
==================================

- Converts your Kirby CMS site to static files: HTML, assets, etc.
- Supports multilingual websites.


How it works
------------

You have a Kirby-powered site. You can [add your content](https://getkirby.com/docs/content/adding-content) manually in the `content` folder or use the Panel. You can [use a theme](http://www.getkirby-themes.com/) or write your own templates and styles. You can preview your website using a local development server such as MAMP or WAMP.

Kirby StaticBuilder doesn’t change any of that. It gives you a basic HTML interface which enables you to build all your site’s pages and write the result in a folder named, you guessed it: `static`.

Note: to get the right result for your site and needs, you may need to tweak some options.
